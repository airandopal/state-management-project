# 4xS: State, Shopify & Sanity Starter


## So, what's the project?
I discovered a [brilliant starter](https://github.com/ndimatteo/HULL) by [@ndimatteo](https://twitter.com/ndimatteo), and I'm all about standing on the shoulders of giants and wise people. Instead of having to setup a headless commerce starter from scratch, I will be able to focus on a few key practices that I would like to include in projects I work on.

## Development Goals
- Refactoring to use state machines 
- Work with multiple machines, including one global app machine 
- Using the state machine to manage api requests
- Animating on state changes using entry / exit actions in state machine
- Error handling with state machines
- Generating tests using xstate
- Forms and xstate (product search)
- Find uses for parallel state machines
...basically state machine all the things, to learn and utilize the various features of xstate and gain a full understanding of the capabilities of the library.

## Who is this for?
### This starter / toolkit is for developers and agencies that have clients that:
- Need to manage custom content related to their Shopify products
- Want more control over store performance 
- Need to control URL structures
- Need better / customized multi-lingual and multi-currency support
- Need to have control over security features

### This starter / toolkit is probably not a great fit for developers and agencies that:
- Have clients who rely heavily on Shopify plugins tied to Shopify themes
- Have clients who need to use the Shopify theme customizer

### Other Benefits
- More design flexibility 
- Potential to create a PWA
- Customize HTTP Headers
- Customize robots.txt
- Customize sitemap.xml 

## How to Use 
1. Review the state machines provided, and use this as a guide to map out the specifications for your project. Customize accordingly.
2. Clone the template
3. Replace the state machines with your customizations.
4. Follow the original Setup Steps https://github.com/ndimatteo/HULL#-manual-set-up
5. Fin!
